                <p> Last changed 2019-07-21.
                </p>


                <p> Please read this End-User License Agreement (EULA) carefully, as it sets out, together with the <a
                        href="#PrivacyAgreement">Privacy Agreement</a> the basis upon which you, the User interacts with
                    us, SWIFTLABS AUCKLAND LIMITED, the Licensor. By continuing to interact with us you agree to be
                    bound by the provisions of this EULA.
                </p>


                <p> SwiftLaTeX is a free, fully automated service offered by SWIFTLABS AUCKLAND LIMITED to you, that
                    lets you edit documents in LaTeX and (a) offers one particularly advanced feature of document
                    engineering, namely a good implementation of true what-you-see-is-what-you-get(WYSIWYG) editing, as
                    defined in research performed by our team, and (b) offers workable other features necessary to
                    access the true WYSIWYG feature in a reasonably large number of use cases, such as editing a typical
                    scientific article. Although in simple cases little or no prior knowledge of LaTeX might be
                    sufficient to use SwiftLaTeX, usually a moderate knowledge of LaTeX easily obtainable from LaTeX
                    online sources is expected from a User.
                </p>


                <p> We intend that our offer of an automated service is of use to you without human intervention from
                    our side, we expect and accept no compensation or service from you. You agree that if you feel at
                    any point that you are about to perform an action that entitles you now or later to any reciprocal
                    action from us or puts us under any obligation, then you abstain from that action and either cease
                    to interact with our site completely or only continue to interact in such a manner that does not put
                    us under any obligation.
                </p>


                <p> The User must not sell, resell, rent, lease, loan, supply, publish, distribute or redistribute the
                    Software. The User must not alter, edit or adapt the Software. The User must not decompile,
                    de-obfuscate or reverse engineer, or attempt to decompile, de-obfuscate or reverse engineer, the
                    Software. </p>


                <p>
                    The software is a beta version provided “as is”; the Licensor may <b>not provide maintenance</b>.
                    the Licensor may <b>not provide documentation</b> beyond the web resources present at time of
                    entering this agreement. The Licensor may <b>not provide support</b> and may not answer to requests.

                <p> The User acknowledges that complex software is never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs; and

                <p> Duration of the EULA and future changes to the Privacy agreement:<br/>
                    Since you do not have any account with SwiftLaTeX.com you are accepting the current EULA with
                    SWIFTLABS AUCKLAND LIMITED with each visit. Since we do not have your email address you agree that
                    is sufficient for us to update the date information with the label 'last changed' at the top of this
                    agreement to notify you about changes to the EULA.
