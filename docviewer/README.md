# XDV Viewer used in SwiftLaTeX

This viewer is built on top of dvi parser from Dr Jim Fowler. 

We enhanced the code so that it can decode the xdv format, which is slightly more complicated than the dvi format. We also remove the parser for tfm fonts, which are not more generated by XeTeX engine.

# DVI Parser

A live demo is available at https://people.math.osu.edu/fowler.291/latex/

Built using https://github.com/FabriceSalvaire/PyDVI and the work of @tmanderson

The goal with this project is to eventually have a complete [DVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format) toolset
written in node. Once complete, this will hopefully be used to implement
TeX document conversions completely in node (particularly a highly configurable
HTML/CSS/JS output).

I'll also be updating the Wiki for those that are interested. Currently, I there's
a [DVI Specification Explained](https://github.com/tmanderson/dvi-parser/wiki/DVI-Specification-Explained) section that I
put together for my own benefit (sourced from a few different online pages).
